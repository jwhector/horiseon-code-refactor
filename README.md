This assignment is an exercise in refactoring existing HTML and CSS code for a search engine optimization company Horiseon.

Primary concerns with refactoring included increasing HTML accessibility by using semantic tags such as `<main>, <section>, <figure>`, and `<aside>`.

Motivation for completing this project was to allow the code to be more robust for future modification, to improve readability, and to add semantics for search enginge and accessibility purposes.
